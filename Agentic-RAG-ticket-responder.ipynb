        "\n",
        "1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enhances LLM responses by retrieving relevant information from knowledge bases before generating answers\n",
        "2. **Agentic Systems**: Uses AI agents that can make decisions, use tools, and take actions autonomously\n",
        "3. **Tool-Using Agents**: Agents that can classify, search, and synthesize information using specialized tools\n",
        "\n",
        "### Our Use Case: Ticket Initial Responder\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem**: Support teams receive many tickets. Many can be answered from existing knowledge bases (FAQs), but manual routing and response is time-consuming.\n",

        "**Solution**: An intelligent agent that:\n",
        "- **Classifies** incoming tickets automatically (DB, DevOps, or Other)\n",
        "- **Retrieves** relevant information from domain-specific FAQ knowledge bases\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Vector Stores (FAISS)**: \n",
        "   - Stores FAQ entries as embeddings for semantic search\n",
        "   - Separate stores for DB and DevOps FAQs\n",
        "   - Enables finding relevant answers even with different wording\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Embeddings (Sentence Transformers)**:\n",
        "   - Converts text to numerical vectors\n",
        "   - Model: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (lightweight, fast, accurate)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **LLM Agent (Groq)**:\n",
        "   - Orchestrates the workflow\n",
        "   - Uses tools to classify and search\n",
        "   - Synthesizes final responses\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Tools**:\n",
        "   - `classify_ticket`: Routes tickets to correct domain\n",
        "   - `check_db_faq`: Searches database FAQ knowledge base\n",
        "   - `check_devops_faq`: Searches DevOps FAQ knowledge base\n",
        "   - `generate_fallback_message`: Creates helpful responses when no FAQ match\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why This Approach?\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Efficiency**: Automates initial ticket triage and response\n",
        "- **Accuracy**: Uses semantic search to find relevant answers\n",
        "- **Scalability**: Can handle multiple FAQ categories\n",
        "- **Flexibility**: Agent decides which tools to use based on ticket content\n",
        "- **Reliability**: Falls back gracefully when no answer is found\n",
